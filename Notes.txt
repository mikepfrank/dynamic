Informal notes about dynamic.

Some concepts/classes:

	* Network - An interlinked set of nodes and components.

	* Port - A named port of a component.
	
	* Node - Has one or more generalized coordinates, has links to ports of
		components.  Has an associated kinetic energy function.
	
	* Link - Idealized wire connecting a port of a component to a node.  Can 
		have an associated generalized coordinate representing a flow of
		something (e.g. charge) down that link, with an associated kinetic  
		energy function (e.g. corresponding to self-inductance).
	
	* BaseComponent - An icon, has associated ports, potential energy function.
		Can also have one or more internal node(s).  This is an abstract base
		class from which subclasses for specific types of components should be 
		derived.
		
	* SimpleNode - Has only one generalized coordinate, equipped with a basic
		quadratic kinetic energy function.
		
	* SimpleLink - Has no associated generalized coordinates representing 
		flows.  Implicitly, however, there can be a transfer of energy 
		down any link, due to the interaction potential energy associated
		with its connected component.
	
	* BaseKineticEnergyFunction - Abstract class for kinetic energy functions.
		Subclasses should know how to evaluate themselves and their partial
		derivatives.
	
	* QuadraticKineticEnergyFunction - A basic quadratic kinetic energy
		function.  Has an associated generalized mass parameter.  Knows
		its partial derivative.
		
	* DynamicNOTGate - A "NOT gate" or logical inverter component implemented 
		in the "dynamic" style; this works via a quadratic potential energy
		function operating on one less than the sum of input and output node 
		coordinates.
		
	* DynamicANDGate - An "AND gate" component implemented in the "dynamic"
		style; this works via a quadratic potential energy function operating
		on the difference between the output node coordinate and the product
		of input node coordinates.
		
	* DynamicORGate - An "OR gate" ...
	
	* DynamicXORGate - An "XOR gate" ...
	
	* BaseDifferentiableFunction
	
	* DynamicNOTFunction

	* PotentialEnergyTerm
