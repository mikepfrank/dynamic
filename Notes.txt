Informal notes about dynamic.

Some concepts/classes:

	* Node - Has one or more generalized coordinates, has links to ports of
		components.  Has an associated kinetic energy function.
	
	* Link - Idealized wire connecting a port of a component to a node.  Can 
		have an associated generalized coordinate representing a flow of
		something (e.g. charge) down that link, with an associated kinetic  
		energy function (e.g. corresponding to self-inductance).
	
	* Component - An icon, has associated ports, potential energy function.
		Can also have one or more internal node(s).
		
	* SimpleNode - Has only one generalized coordinate, equipped with a basic
		quadratic kinetic energy function.
		
	* SimpleLink - Has no associated generalized coordinates representing 
		flows.  Implicitly, however, there can be a transfer of energy 
		down any link, due to the interaction potential energy associated
		with its connected component.
		
	* QuadraticKineticEnergyFunction - A basic quadratic kinetic energy
		function.  Has an associated generalized mass parameter.  Knows
		its partial derivative.
