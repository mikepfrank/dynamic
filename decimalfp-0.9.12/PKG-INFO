Description: The module `decimalfp` provides a `Decimal` number type which can represent
        decimal numbers of arbitrary magnitude and arbitrary precision, i.e. any
        number of fractional digits.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        `decimalfp.Decimal` instances are created by giving a `value` (default: 0) and
        a `precision` (i.e the number of fractional digits, default: None).
        
        If `precision` is given, it must be of type `int` and >= 0.
        
        If `value` is given, it must either be a string (type `str` or `unicode` in
        Python 2.x, `bytes` or `str` in Python 3.x), an instance of `number.Integral`
        (for example `int` or `long` in Python 2.x, `int` in Python 3.x),
        `number.Rational` (for example `fractions.Fraction`), `decimal.Decimal` or
        `float` or be convertable to a `float` or an `int`.
        
        If a string is given as value, it must be a string in one of two formats:
        
        * [+|-]<int>[.<frac>][<e|E>[+|-]<exp>] or
        * [+|-].<frac>[<e|E>[+|-]<exp>].
        
        The value is always adjusted to the given precision or the precision is
        calculated from the given value, if no precision is given.
        
        When the given `precision` is lower than the precision of the given `value`,
        the result is rounded, according to the rounding mode of the current context
        held by the standard module `decimal` (which defaults to ROUND_HALF_EVEN, in
        contrast to the `round` function in Python 2.x !!!).
        
        When no `precision` is given and the given `value` is a `float` or a
        `numbers.Rational` (but no `Decimal`), the `Decimal` constructor tries to
        convert `value` exactly. But, for performance reasons, this is done only up a
        fixed limit of fractional digits. This limit defaults to 32 and is accessible
        as `decimalfp.LIMIT_PREC`. If `value` can not be represented as a `Decimal`
        within this limit, an exception is raised.
        
        `Decimal` does not deal with infinity, division by 0 always raises a
        `ZeroDivisionError`. Likewise, infinite instances of type `float` or
        `decimal.Decimal` can not be converted to `Decimal` instances. The same is
        true for the 'not a number' instances of these types.
        
        Computations
        ------------
        
        When importing `decimalfp`, its `Decimal` type is registered in Pythons
        numerical stack as `number.Rational`. It supports all operations defined for
        that base class and its instances can be mixed in computations with instances
        of all numeric types mentioned above.
        
        All numerical operations give an exact result, i.e. they are not automatically
        constraint to the precision of the operands or to a number of significant
        digits (like the floating-point `Decimal` type from the standard module
        `decimal`). When the result can not exactly be represented by a `Decimal`
        instance within the limit given by `decimalfp.LIMIT_PREC`, an instance of
        `fractions.Fraction` is returned.
        
        `Decimal` supports rounding via the built-in function `round` using the same
        rounding mode as the `float` type by default (i.e. ROUND_HALF_UP in Pyhton 2.x
        and ROUND_HALF_EVEN in Python 3.x). In addition, via the method `adjusted` a
        `Decimal` with a different precision can be derived, supporting all rounding
        modes defined by the standard library module `decimal`.
