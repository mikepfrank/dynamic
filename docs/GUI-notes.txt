Some notes on the GUI.

* For each network being simulated, have a window titled: "Network Visualizer for network '<netName>'".
* The window contains a Canvas.
* Gates appear as boxes.  (Later icons.)
* Links are lines from gate ports to nodes.
* Nodes appear as gray dots with a white crosshairs over the.
* Phase portrait tangle is superimposed over the crosshairs.
* Trail that gradually fades out to black as you go back in time, over, say, 100 or 1000 time-steps.

Future improvements (lower priority):

* Make the link a spline
* Create another simulation to allow the visual elements of the network to move around dynamically, within limits
	- Splines coming out of gates try not to get too sharply bent
	- Links try to stay close to some desired length
	- Motion is damped (unlike in the underlying dynamical system)

Some classes:
-------------

* Viewable - Base class for model objects with attached views.  Some methods:
	- registerView() - Registers a new view of this object.
	- updateViews() - Updates all registered views (because the object has changed).

* BaseView - Base class for views.
	- update() - Updates this view.

* NetworkVisualizer - View for networks.
