# Dynamic miscellaneous documentation files (`dynamic/docs/`).

This directory contains auxilliary documentation files and 
miscellaneous notes for the Dynamic system.  Please note that 
the main API documentation is embedded in the source code 
documentation strings, and can be viewed in HTML form by 
running the `dynamic/batch/demo-docs.bat` script.

## 1. Code cleanup notes (`cleanup-notes.txt`).

I am presently making a pass through the entire source tree 
to make sure all the code is cleaned up and well-documented.  
This file is just to keep track of which files have been 
brought up to the current target.

## 2. GUI notes (`GUI-notes.txt`).

Notes on features we plan to implement in the graphical user 
interface.

## 3. Main notes file (`Notes.txt`).

General notes on the structure of the Dynamic code base.
Not completely up-to-date.

## 4. README file (`README.md`).
