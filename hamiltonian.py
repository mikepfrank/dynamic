#|      Synopsis:
#|      ---------
#|
#|          This module provides various classes related to a
#|          Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics.
#|
#|          The most important class is PotentialEnergyTerm,
#|          which defines a class of potential energy function
#|          that depends on a set of generalized coordinates
#|          (their generalized positions, but not their
#|          velocities).  The partial derivatives of the
#|          potential with respect to the position variables
#|          can be retrieved in order to extract force
#|          components, which (together with those for other
#|          potential energy terms in which a given coordinate
#|          appears) are used to update velocity variables.
#|
#|          Additional classes will be defined as needed.
