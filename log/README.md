# Log directory (`dynamic/log/`).

This directory exists for the sole purpose of providing a place for the 
Dynamic simulator to put log files created during execution.  The main
log file created is `Dynamic.demo.log`.

Part of the purpose of this README.md file is so that git will create 
this directory for us when the repo is cloned.
