    FILE NAME:      appdefs.py                   [Python module source code]

    MODULE NAME:    appdefs

    SYSTEM NAME:    Dynamic (simulator for dynamic networks)

    SW COMPONENT:   Dynamic.logging


    MODULE DESCRIPTION:
    -------------------

          Application-specific definitions.

          This file defines some parameters specific to the present
          application.  It may be utilized from within general-
          purpose modules to customize those modules for this
          particular application.

          At present, we are only using this to define <systemName>
          and <appName> parameters, which are used to compose names
          of system-specific and application-specific loggers. Also,
          <topFile> is utilized in logger output.

          E.g., the logger for a module or component that is specific
          to the system (but not to the particular application program)
          would be called "<systemName>.<othername>", whereas the logger
          for a module specific to the present application would be
          called "<appName>.<othername>".  Further, <appName> itself
          should begin with "<systemName>."

        appdefs.systemName:str                  [global constant string]
        
                This string gives the name of the overall
                system that the present application is a
                part of.  Lexically it should be a standard
                identifier (alphanumeric string).

                
        appdefs.appName:str                     [global constant string]

                This string gives the name of the present
                application (as a component of the overall
                system).  It consists of the <systemName>
                followed by a "." and an identifier
                specifying this application (as distinct
                from other components of the system).


        appdefs.topFile:str                     [global constant string]
        
                This string gives the name of the top-level
                file of the present application, sans the .py
                extension.
